1,CreateFlowTemplate,Creates a workflow template. Workflows can be created only in the user's namespace. (The public namespace contains only entities.) The workflow can contain only entities in the specified namespace. The workflow is validated against the entities in the latest version of the user's namespace unless another namespace version is specified in the request,Write,,,
2,CreateSystemInstance,Creates an instance of a system with specified configurations and Things,Write,,aws:RequestTag/${TagKey}  aws:TagKeys,
3,CreateSystemTemplate,Creates a system. The system is validated against the entities in the latest version of the user's namespace unless another namespace version is specified in the request,Write,,,
4,DeleteFlowTemplate,Deletes a workflow. Any new system or system instance that contains this workflow will fail to update or deploy. Existing system instances that contain the workflow will continue to run (since they use a snapshot of the workflow taken at the time of deploying the system instance),Write,Workflow*,,
5,DeleteNamespace,Deletes the specified namespace. This action deletes all of the entities in the namespace. Delete the systems and flows in the namespace before performing this action,Write,,,
6,DeleteSystemInstance,"Deletes a system instance. Only instances that have never been deployed, or that have been undeployed from the target can be deleted. Users can create a new system instance that has the same ID as a deleted system instance",Write,SystemInstance*,,
7,DeleteSystemTemplate,Deletes a system. New system instances can't contain the system after its deletion. Existing system instances that contain the system will continue to work because they use a snapshot of the system that is taken when it is deployed,Write,System*,,
8,DeploySystemInstance,Deploys the system instance to the target specified in CreateSystemInstance,Write,SystemInstance*,,
9,DeprecateFlowTemplate,"Deprecates the specified workflow. This action marks the workflow for deletion. Deprecated flows can't be deployed, but existing system instances that use the flow will continue to run",Write,Workflow*,,

12,DissociateEntityFromThing,Dissociates a device entity from a concrete thing. The action takes only the type of the entity that you need to dissociate because only one entity of a particular type can be associated with a thing,Write,,,iot:DescribeThing  iot:DescribeThingGroup
13,GetEntities,Gets descriptions of the specified entities. Uses the latest version of the user's namespace by default,Read,,,
14,GetFlowTemplate,Gets the latest version of the DefinitionDocument and FlowTemplateSummary for the specified workflow,Read,Workflow*,,

16,GetNamespaceDeletionStatus,Gets the status of a namespace deletion task,Read,,,
17,GetSystemInstance,Gets a system instance,Read,SystemInstance*,,
18,GetSystemTemplate,Gets a system,Read,System*,,
19,GetSystemTemplateRevisions,"Gets revisions made to the specified system template. Only the previous 100 revisions are stored. If the system has been deprecated, this action will return the revisions that occurred before its deprecation. This action won't work with systems that have been deleted",Read,System*,,
20,GetUploadStatus,Gets the status of the specified upload,Read,,,
21,ListFlowExecutionMessages,Lists details of a single workflow execution,List,,,
22,ListTagsForResource,Lists all tags for a given resource,List,SystemInstance,,

26,SearchSystemInstances,Searches for system instances in the user's account,Read,,,
27,SearchSystemTemplates,Searches for summary information about systems in the user's account. You can filter by the ID of a workflow to return only systems that use the specified workflow,Read,,,

32,UntagResource,Untag a specified resource,Tagging,SystemInstance,,
33,UntagResource,Untag a specified resource,Tagging,,aws:TagKeys,
34,UpdateFlowTemplate,Updates the specified workflow. All deployed systems and system instances that use the workflow will see the changes in the flow when it is redeployed. The workflow can contain only entities in the specified namespace,Write,Workflow*,,
